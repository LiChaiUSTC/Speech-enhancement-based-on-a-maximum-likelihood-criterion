.SH NAME
sndcmp - statistics for one or two soundfiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsndcmd
[\-d \fIframes\fB]
[\-S \fIsffmt\fB]
[\-T \fIsffmt\fB]
\fIsound1\fB
[\fIsound2\fB

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PN sndcmp
reports statistics on a soundfile, and the difference between two 
soundfiles.  It will also write out the residual difference between 
two soundfiles.  Specifying a single input file reports the mean, 
standard deviation and rms values for the samples in each channel of 
the soundfile.  The samples are treated as integers, i.e. scaled 
between -32768 and 32767.  RMS and standard deviation values will 
match only when the mean is zero.
.P
Specifying two files will report these statistics for each file and 
also for their difference (sound1 minus sound2).  In this way, 
transcoded soundfiles can be quickly compared for overall distortion 
levels.  Specifying a third soundfile name causes the program to 
write out a soundfile corresponding to the difference between the 
two files (again, sound1 minus sound2).
.P
A fixed time-skew between the two files can be specified with the 
-d option.  If the argument is positive, that many frames at the beginning 
of the first soundfile will be skipped, and the remainder used for 
comparison with sound2.  If sound2 is delayed with respect to sound1, 
the argument should be negative, and specify the number of timeframes 
of delay.  Trial and error may be required to find the alignment between 
two related files than minimizes the RMS difference between them.
.P
.PN sndcmp
exits with a code of 0 (no error) unless a difference is found between 
a pair of input files, in which case the exit code is 1.
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.TP 12
\fB\-S \fIsffmt\fR
Force the input soundfile to be treated as the type specified by 
the keyword.  This only applies if the 
.MS sndf 3
library has been compiled to use run-time determination of soundfile 
type; otherwise this option is ignored.  When it is active, the 
available soundfile keywords are listed in the usage message:
.EX
sndrfmt --
.EE
but currently include "AIFF" (Mac/SGI), "NeXT" (Sun/NeXT *.au/*.snd), 
"MSWAVE" (Microsoft RIFF/WAVE), "NIST" (NIST/SPHERE) and "PCM" 
(raw data, format optionally controlled by PCMFORMAT environment 
string, see
.MS sndf 3
).

.TP 12
\fB\-T \fIsffmt\fR
Under the runtime-dynamic version of the soundfile library, forces 
the output soundfile to be treated as the type specified by 
the keyword (see the -S option above).  If not specified, the 
output soundfile type will match the input.

.SH BUGS
I'd like to add an optional cross-correlation to guess the best 
temporal alignment of the two files based on some chunk at the 
beginning, but I never have.  It would also be nice if it attempted 
to find an optimal scaling factor.  Scale factor(s) should be 
optionally provided as arguments.
.SH NOTES
This program was developed while the author was working at Aware, Inc. 
and subsequently at the MIT Media Lab.
.P
The program uses the soundfile access library of 
.MS sndf 3
which defines the kind of soundfile it will recognize, depending 
on its compilation options.
