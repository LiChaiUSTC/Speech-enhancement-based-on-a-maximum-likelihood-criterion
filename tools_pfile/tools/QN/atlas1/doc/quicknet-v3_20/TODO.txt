 - function for arbitrarily combining label streams
 - SRI feature files
 - sub-epochs
 - multiple code books for unary_input
 - fix logging for single-utterance files so they are per-utterance not

v    - configuration &c for clean compile within SPRACHcore
v    - qncopy program
v - From /u/fosler/quicknet:
v    - bunchmode for single-spert training (some routines into fxlib)
v    - "smoothdecay" learnrate_schedule
v    - per-layer initialization of weight/bias ranges
v - ILab run-length encoded binary label file format (incl. man page)
v - Ascii In/Out FtrLabStream to support pfile_print, pfile_build-style
    functionality in feacat etc.
v - Integrate with multispert code
     - host={cpu|spert} num_slaves={0..4}
  - QN_Range from feacat & range specs for train_sent etc.
  - pasting together of pfiles both side-to-side and end-to-end
