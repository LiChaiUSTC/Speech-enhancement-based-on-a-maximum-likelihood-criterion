// QN_MLP is a base class used to define an interface to MLPs
//
// It is designed to hide as much as possible, so allowing a variety of
// implementations - specifically fixed point implementations on SPERT.
// Efficiency is a key issue.
//
// Some notable points:
//
// - It does forward pass or training on multiple frames at a time.
//   This is more
//   efficient even for online training (e.g. conversions to/from float are
//   done on larger vectors), but also allows batch-like training using the
//   same interface.
// - No inherent knowledge of file formats etc.
// - Flexible with regard to initialization and learning rates.
// - No file format information encoded - get the weights out yourself
//   and do what you want with them.
// - No separate backward pass - being as the state from the forward pass
//   is needed to go backward, we have to do forward then backward for 
//   training to be meaningful.
// - Most stuff hidden - you can change the implementation as you require.
